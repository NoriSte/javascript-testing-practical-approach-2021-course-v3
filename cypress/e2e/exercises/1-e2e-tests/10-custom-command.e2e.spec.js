/**
 * Main goals
 * - Write a custom command that abstracts away the authentication code
 *
 * Additional goals
 * - Control logging instead of using Cypress' default one
 *
 * What to learn
 * - Shortening the test
 * - Abstracting away the repetitive code
 *
 * What to think about
 * - Keeping the abstraction level as low as possible (let's talk about the PageObject model...)
 * - How could you speed up the test without using `type`?
 *
 * Testing rules
 * - Keep the test code simple, stupid! DRY it as few as possible
